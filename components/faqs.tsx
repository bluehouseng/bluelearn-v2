                ... everyone learns at a different pace, but students who put in
                2-3 hours each day to apply what they’re learning in the
                lectures should be able to confidently build their own projects,
                start interviewing and get hired in 3-6 months
                <br />
                We don’t see just getting hired as the end goal though. We
                believe in lifelong learning. Our intermediate and advanced
                courses will teach you the topics and skills you need to get
                promoted and take your career to the next level.

                Yes, you’d be crazy not to in our slightly biased opinion! All

                Many of our students tell us the projects they built while
                following along with our courses were what got them interviews
                and because they built the projects themselves, they could
                confidently explain and walk through their work during the
                interview.
